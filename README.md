# Bidirectional-Power-Supply
Development of a bidirectional DC/DC power supply for battery applications.
The designed developement board will be capable of charging a battery as well producing a stable 5V output from the li-ion battery.

The developement board is easily configurable through serial communication, have test points for all the important signals and includes feedback LEDs.

## Specification:
 - Input-DC: 5V/4A
 - Input-Battery: 3.7V/8A
 - Output-DC: 5V/3A
