# Bidirectional-Power-Supply
Development of a bidirectional DC/DC power supply for battery applications.

The designed **developement** board is a **BUCK/BOOST converter**, based on the direction of the power flow. This enables us to charge a battery with voltage reduction or create an uninterrupted voltage output with voltage boost.

The developement board is easily configurable through serial communication, have test points for all the important signals and includes feedback LEDs.

## Directories
- Altium: **Altium** project of the hardware.
- CSS: **Code Composer Studio** project and other tools to flash the microcontroller
