# Bidirectional-Power-Supply
Development of a bidirectional DC/DC power supply for battery applications.

The designed **developement** board is a **BUCK/BOOST converter**, based on the direction of the power flow. This enables us to charge a battery with voltage reduction or create an uninterrupted voltage output with voltage boost.

The developement board is easily configurable through serial communication, have test points for all the important signals and includes feedback LEDs.
